        <h2> What is liber-tea</h2>
        <p> As all of super earth's citizen know, liber-tea is our preferred beverage. It was created during the first galactic war, and to keep our noble 
            HELLDIVERS refreshed and ready to be deployed, the ministry of science tried adding E-710, and the result was spectacular. It is now
            consumed by every citizen in a much more diluted version, altough it is still very useful.
        </p>
        <h2> How to brew liber tea</h2>
        <p> To brew liber-tea, there are several steps: </p>
        <ul> 
            <li>you must first prove to yourself that <a href="propaganda.html">you have the strength and the courage to be free.</a></li>
            <li>after that, pick a cup, brew a little tea, and add two drop of E-710. [this content has been approved by a democratic officer]</li>
        </ul>
       <p>[a lot of terminids were harmed in the making of this page]</p> 
       <h2>Where to find E-710</h2>
       <p>E-710 is our primary energy source, and it is a byproduct of the undemocratic terminids. The method of extraction is done by our 
        glorius HELLDIVERS, who use advanced technologies like the one below, to kill as many as they can, and after that our brave SEAF will collect the 
        bodies and bring them to specialised centers to harvest the E-710.
