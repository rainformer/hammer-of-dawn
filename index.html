        <h1>LIBER-TEA</h1>

        <div class="div1">
        <h2> What is liber-tea</h2>
        <p> As all of super earth's citizen know, liber-tea is our preferred beverage. It was created during the first galactic war, and to keep our noble 
            HELLDIVERS refreshed and ready to be deployed, the ministry of science tried adding E-710, and the result was spectacular. It is now
            consumed by every citizen in a much more diluted version, altough it is still very useful.
        </p>
        <h2> How to brew liber tea</h2>
        <p> To brew liber-tea, there are several steps: </p>
        <ul> 
            <li>you must first prove to yourself that <a href="propaganda.html">you have the strength and the courage to be free.</a></li>
            <li>after that, pick a cup, brew a little tea, and add two drop of E-710. [this content has been approved by a truth enforcerer]</li>
        </ul>
       <p>[a lot of Terminids were harmed in the making of this page]</p> 
       <h2>Where to find E-710</h2>
       <p>E-710 is our primary energy source, and it is a byproduct of the undemocratic terminids. The method of extraction is done by our 
        glorius HELLDIVERS, who use advanced technologies like the one below, to kill as many as they can, and after that our brave SEAF will collect the 
        bodies and bring them to specialised centers to harvest the E-710.
       </p>

       <h2>Why are Terminids enemies?</h2>
       <p>Terminids are our enemies because they desire the fall of Super Earth and the demise of all its citizens, while also being
         undemocratic xenos. As seen in the recent times, Terminids have also the capacity to mutate in unpredictable ways while 
         in the gloom, so it is only a given to destroy this threat before it destroys our way of life.
       </p>
       <h2>Why should i join the HELLDIVERS?</h2>
       <p>HELLDIVERS are an elite military force, with the objective of spreading managed democracy and defending Super Earth's territories
        and population. It is the greatest honor any citizen should desire, while also being one of the most rewarding experiences in the 
        entire sol system.
       </p>
       <h2>What are the threats to Super Earth?</h2>
       <p>There are three principal external threats:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Automatons: robots that have discarded their humanity, they are a major threat because of their vile technology and heavily
            armored units, such as Hulks and Factory Striders.
        </li>
        <li>Illuminates: enemies in the First Galactic War, they have returned with mind-controlling powers and weapons of mass destruction,
            while also being a major threat thanks to their manipulation of the Meridia black hole, which, if left untouched, will collide
            with Super Earth. 
        </li>
        <li>Terminids: as mentioned above.</li>
       </ul>
